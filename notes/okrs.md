Bit of a ramble below. I’ll tidy this up into a blog post, I promise.

tl;dr: OKR all the things.

Oh my. OKRs again. 

As others have pointed out, they don't de-scale. I would argue that the only reason to have them at the departmental level is to highlight impact of Conway's Law on your organisation. At the team or individual level? Well... something, something, Heisenberg; something, something, get what you measure....
So I’ve been having what seems like the opposite experience in several organisations I’m working with, from several hundred to a couple of thousand people scale, but not yet at the tens-of-thousands scale Chris Matts has been exploring.
As with any tool, OKRs are going to be misunderstood, misapplied, and just plain abused, but when they are framed properly and implemented sensibly I’ve seen them bring order and direction to organisations that lacked both.
There are only a few rules with OKRs, but if you scrimp on any of them the whole thing will most likely fail at best, and backfire badly at worst. I’ve been thinking about writing a blog post about my experiences using OKRs as a tool for alignment and lean transformation, but in the meantime this is what I’ve learned:
1. They are not a target, they are an aspiration.
They started as a counter to Management By Objectives (MBO) because the latter sets people up for failure because they set ambitious objectives, which eventually leads to rewarding mediocrity as people set easy, modest objectives and score big by landing them. The Key Results should be outrageous in their ambition. I coach them as “Imagine it’s three months time and you’ve just had the best quarter you could possibly have had. What did you achieve that completely amazed you?” The quote I like is “If you aim for the moon and miss, at least you had a great view!”
A really good quarter will land 70-80% across most of your KRs. If you are getting more than this they aren’t ambitious enough.
2. You never measure people on their OKRs. Never.
As soon as you do this they become targets (see 1) and people will start to game them. As someone else said, they are an alignment tool not a measurement tool. In organisations that do annual or semi-annual reviews, you are encouraged to look back over your individual and team OKRs for the period since your last review to remind yourself of the journey, and to pull out what you and your team(s) achieved as part of the narrative. So instead of saying “We aimed for 4% increase in market share but only achieved 2.5%,” it is more like “We achieved 2.5% increase in market share over a quarter, which is fantastic! And which I had completely forgotten about because of all the stuff that has happened since!”
3. OKRs cascade down from as high as you can start them.
In one organisation I have the CEO and his board setting them quarterly; in another the IT leadership; in another the Head of Engineering and his team across about half the IT organisation. In each case, each Outcome (I prefer this language to Objective) is something the organisation can rally around, and the KRs are big ambitions for each outcome. It is quite common for the Os to roll on for several quarters, going after different KRs in each quarter.
4. “Cascading” is not as obvious as you think.
In any decent-sized organisation you have lots of managers and management groups—think practice or guild leads, department managers, middle and senior line management functions—and control functions like PMO or Change groups. It turns out cascading isn’t so obvious for them.
I start with my working definition that the goal of an organisational system is to optimise for rapid and sustainable flow of value (a discussion for another time, work with me here), and then to think of what that means for this organisation for this quarter.
Some OKRs will be about value in the form of measurable, customer impact. Others will be about improving flow by reducing lead time, reducing batch size, eliminating obstacles or changing the org structure to make it easier to get work done. Others will be about the sustainable elements such as happiness of people, managing costs, reducing fragmentation across different autonomous groups, or whatever else we feel might make sustainability harder if we don’t go after it.
In the organisations I work in, people are members of various groups with different responsibilities, so a manager might be part of a working group looking at improving flow in the Path to Live, they might be the executive sponsor of a product delivering customer value, and may also have a formal compliance role. Their individual OKRs would express each of these, and describe how, if they have an amazing quarter, they would contribute to the success of the various groups they interact with, and thus the organisation’s overall goals for the quarter.
5. So if they aren’t a target, what is the point?
The reason for having individual and team OKRs is to create a sense of alignment at various levels of the organisation, and importantly to provide people with a vehicle to say No, or at least Not Yet. This is surprisingly difficult in most organisations, especially if the ask is yet another of the 1,000 tiny cuts that sound fine on their own but which together will derail everything you are trying to achieve. “I would love to but that doesn’t align with our OKRs. Maybe next quarter.” becomes a legitimate pushback.
You are only ever pushing things out by a maximum of 12 weeks, which is a blink in corporate time, but seems to be just enough for the request to (usually) dissipate naturally. If it is still there it can be considered for the next quarter.
I’m seeing some real behavioural change from senior managers and execs due to OKRs, as well as an increase in focus in the organisations I’m coaching, but it is taking a lot of “No, we still don’t use them to measure people” conversations.
6. You will stuff it up at least twice
OKRs are hard. They are proper strategy rather than the usual hand-wavy stuff. They are a deceptively simple model but there are a number of failure modes I’ve been seeing:
6a. Conflation of the person and the department.
Department heads will declare the things they personally want to go after as department-level OKRs, which can make them too tactical, e.g. “Fix Project X” rather than “Ensure all major projects are on track”. This can leave other teams that aren’t working on Project X thinking “How does that apply to me?”
Conversely their individual OKRs might say something like “Decommission 3 legacy systems.” I counter this by asking "What, are you personally going to do that in the next 12 weeks?”
6b. Thinking about them as MBO-style objectives.
People start treating them as personal goals they will be measured against, and hedge accordingly. Cue the usual hand-wringing and gaming of traditional MBOs.
6c. Getting stuck in the weeds.
Honestly, it’s only for 12 weeks. Even if we stuff this up badly (which we will), what is the worst that could happen in a quarter? People can definitely overthink OKRs and it is important to coach them past that.
7. They only happen quarterly!
So even if you pick things up quickly, and have an organisation that picks things up quickly, it will take at least 3 or 4 quarters before you start to reap the real rewards. One of my clients started a little over a year ago, and they recently told me OKRs have “transformed how we do strategy”, “created alignment between Engineering, Marketing and other departments we didn’t think was possible”, and “caused peace to break out in the management team.”

While I’m here I’ll have a go at Jack’s question below:

Some questions to ponder...
What will be different once you have them?
Alignment and the ability to say Not Yet.
What do you mean they would benefit - How?
Do they have to be measurable or can they be qualitative?
Absolutely measurable. This is not negotiable.
Do they have to be objectives, cause if so, what's the problem if you don't meet them? what if they meet others instead?
They are aspirations. You don’t expect to meet them, you expect to talk about what happened when you tried. Over beer. 
By taking the time to identify and set them as an upfront management exercise, are you inhibiting the teams' growth and creativity and/or ability to be reactive to market conditions? Would a reflective evaluation be more useful as a barometer of effectiveness?
If the market turns upside-down on you in an unpredictable way within a 12 week window, you should probably stop and regroup in any case. This doesn’t happen that often.
Defining the Objectives well in the first place is hard work and takes time and understanding. What will you do with your new teams while you learn enough about their situations (and possibly the company's) to do this?
The teams are learning this too. They will stuff it up too. We are all learning together. I’ve been starting with the management team and figuring it out from there.
Getting cartographical here.... I have an objective to be in Barcelona on the 27th. I have another objective to be in Malaga on the 30th. I have another objective to be in Malta by the 14th of the next month. Am I visiting these places for their own value, or am I choosing specific stops on a journey for [reasons] but actually only the end destination matters? What if I have to choose between Malaga on the 30th and Barcelona on the 27th? What if my reason for being in Barca could be better served by being in Ibiza two days later? What you need is an understanding of your organisation's strategy in order to understand the priorities and dependencies, and to make decisions as locally as possible with as little external help/support as possible.
Those aren’t objectives in an OKR sense. At best they are commitments, or maybe just current arrangements. What is the purpose of each of those trips? If they don’t align with this quarter’s OKRs you now have magical powers to cancel them and no-one will mind!
OKRs are how you align the organisation with that strategy you talked about. In Andy Grove / John Doerr terms that is most likely an annual conversation: “What are we going after this year? Geographical expansion? Product diversity? Product consolidation? Reducing our operating footprint?” Then the OKRs are how that strategy plays out—and evolves—across the year.
Say you've got that. Do you care how I get there? No? - don't need key results.
How do you keep track of what you achieved? And how that contributes at an individual, team(s), department, etc. level to the success of the organisation’s strategy? Because someone is going to ask.
And do you really care if I even get there, as long as where I've gotten to was a reasonable outcome? No? - don't need objectives.
How will you know if it's a reasonable outcome? You've got an understanding of the strategy.

YMMV, but IMExperience, OKRs are used when mgmt is too far removed from the business environment they are operating in and/or the people in their departments tasked with moving the org forward. It's been a clumsy attempt to assert some kind of control by injecting themselves between the creators and their consumers.
That sounds like an unfortunate implementation. The intent is to create a sense of urgency and to "think big” about what amazing progress might look like. Nothing more.
Define a north star (guiding principle(s)), give them a map that shows the lay of the land, not a route (make sure any existing constraints are well known - regulatory, market, ...), and empower them to get on with it.
Couldn’t agree more. And OKRs are the best tool I’ve yet found for doing this. Again YMMV and it will be bumpy etc.

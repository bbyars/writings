QA Value:
- Preventing bugs (traditional QA)
- Detecting bugs (traditional monitoring)
- Remediating bugs (traditional support)

QA strategy incorporates all 3
- look at logs, alerts, graphs, trends to improve quality of product

Security:
- Bring visibility to team, show them how their app is being attacked
- Business brings risk profile
- Segment risk by infra / functionality (tokenization, dev networks)
    - benefits of micro services involves segmenting risk

Devops
- Commoditize the release process
- Standard work, continually increase the signals you pay attention to as sensitivity to error improves
- This is production (in the manufacturing sense) and should be treated as such

Development
- This is design and should be organized around learning and rapid feedback

Broader than customer facing dev
- SAP, POS, enterprise

3 types of teams:
1. agile teams - you know the problem, and mostly know the solution
2. innovation teams - you know the problem and need to discover the solution
3. entrepreneurial teams - you know you have a problem but need to crystallize it (lots of ambiguity)


Types of caching:
- App cache
- Network cache (proxy)
- Single server cache (files on disk)
- Global Server cache (memcached)

This is the concise overview I mentioned  of how vision, strategy, roadmaps and execution all fit together

Great read!

Much longer read, but I also got a lot out of Warfighting (the Marine's manual, which has a lot to teach us about agile). The concepts are very similar:
* Mission -> The objective of being in a certain theater of war
* Strategy -> "Commander's intent", what the higher ups are trying to accomplish (e.g. control the bridge to prevent the enemy from escaping across the river). Combined with "Main effort" - the unit that we prioritize support for.
* Roadmap -> "operations" -> commander-provided theory of how the unit will accomplish the mission
* Execution -> "Mission tactics" -> what the subordinates actually do when they're being shot at. Near absolute autonomy so long as it aligns with commander's intent.

Security

Need 200 firewalls to keep up with latency of a switch
Firewalls no longer useful outside of separating internet from your network
The security boundary is not the service
Every single service should imagine its on the public internet
Layer 3 and 4 no longer appropriate for thinking about security, needs to be layer 7
every service should be authz and authn

Product / Service orientation:
* https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/14/why-amazon-is-eating-the-world/
* Pitfalls of vertical integration: initial cost-savings through insourcing, but market inefficiencies with captive customer and no competition erode those over time
* Amazon converting contact center as external service (Amazon Connect) - if failure externally, indicates the internal operation is inefficient
    * Converted survey-based feedback loop into revenue-based feedback loop
* Fulfillment by Amazon can even ship orders not sold on Amazon; exposes internal warehouse ops as product
    * 3rd party seller services totaled $6.4B in Q1 2017, 25% of revenue
    * Taken largest cost center (fulfillment and shipping) and externalized it, preventing bloat
    * Enormous bootstrap costs, leaders had to create when internal market too inefficient, operated at loss for long time
* Productized tech (AWS), Fulfillment (FBA), COGS, shipping
* Key advantage they have over everyone else is that they are forced to use their own services; nowhere for poor performance to hide
* Found a way to beat the Innovatorâ€™s Dilemma

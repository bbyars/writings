Shared Services
Vanguard method
John Seddon - shared services accept more demand, but much of it is failure demand
- call center; measured by average call time and number of calls
- more calls and less time per call, but many from the same customer because they didn’t get their question answered the first time
- failure demand (demand caused by a failure to do something or do something right for the
customer

in The Goal, he mentions profit as the goal of the company
- we lose sight of that a bit when we introduce standard accounting practices like opex and capex
- world com cheated by moving open to capex
- economists talk of complentarity
- opex encourages high utilization because it’s just a cost center with no amortization - complementarity
- high utilization shuts down the value stream, meaning that the capex product teams get stymied

Finance
benchmarking instead of budgeting

Beyond Budgeting:
Handelsbanken = among most cost efficient banks in the world, all w/o budgets
1. Drive performance through transparent and relative internal benchmarking amongst branches and regions
2. Provide local autonomy for each branch & region to lift performance 
3. Collective bonuses, not individual bonuses, and base them on benchmarking against other banks

everybody tries to improve.  At the top, you want to maintain your relative position.  At the bottom, you don’t want to stay there
shares go into a fund that is invested, including in Handelsbanken.  You get the $ at retirement or leaving the company.  No short-term carrots

Jack Welch - “”Budgets are the bane of corporate America”

p. 69:
Traditional budgeting has many weaknesses…
- Conflicting purposes - target setting vs. financial forecasting
- Not only a ceiling - also a floor for costs
- Promotes centralization of decisions and responsibilities
- Inflexible to changes in planning assumptions
- Tends to make financial control an annual event
- Absorbs significant resources across the organization
   p. 48 - According to the Hackett Group, companies spend on average 25,000 man-days on budgeting per $1B USD revenue

Replaced budgeting with:
- rolling 5-quarter forecasts
    - Borealis used next year’s forecast as the budget to report to owners - Statoil and Neste (can do departmentally?)
- balanced scorecards
- from absolute to relative performance
   - avoids macro-economic changes (e.g. boom/bust cycle in oil)
   - gives business units authority to invest if it improves the relative KPIs
- trend reporting
- activity based costing (showing why money was spent rather than what it was spent on)
- investment management
  - small projects, treated essentially as operating expense even if they were an investment
  - medium projects - case by case hurdle rate.  tight forecasting tightened the funnel
  - major projects - never managed through an annual budget anyway (e.g. acquisition)

Economies of Scale
Two arguments, both based on costs:
1. The organisation design argument: specialisation and standardisation will lead to lower costs
and greater productivity
2. The savings argument: cost savings will be made through common IT systems, less buildings
and fewer managers. 

economies of scale reduce the unit cost, but they introduce costs that didn’t previously exist in the inventory and wait time
  between subprocesses.

- concerned with unit cost.  Ohno concerned himself with total cost, and crucially added inventory as a cost rather than an asset, forcing him to consider how long a part was in the system
- what is critical is the availability of the part, not it’s cost
- greater economy comes from flow, not scale
- Toyota also supported variety, which goes against economies of scale
- ironically, specialization and standardization increase failure demand
- work designed around flow of delivering value to customer reduces failure deman

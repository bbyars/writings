Principles:
- Provide back pressure: Align incentives between teams so the service provider isnâ€™t abused
   - Google error budgets
   - chargebacks
- Education through shared service
   - Security dashboards of real time attacks in team areas
- Self service over ticketing
- Commoditize production (run)
- Rally to enable design (develop)
   - DX
- Design to throw away
   - Interfaces more important than implementation

Decision making:
- Need Goal / Problem filtered through op model, true north, filtered through to solution
- Make all boxes explicit: Biz Goal -> Problem Statement -> Mental Model -> Solution
- mental model could be arch. principles, op. model, etc

Ops / Security / Development = 3 sides of the triangle pulling in different directions
- Commoditize ops, optimize DX, constrain as appropriate with security

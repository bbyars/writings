Avoid big foundation “pyramid-style” approach
- Think layers: Core data + augmentation + orchestration to merge

Use automation to help crowdsourcing approaches for data cataloging

MDM hasn’t really advanced in past decade
- Most big vendors purport to manage data governance and MDM using proprietary rules engine
- requires rules curation, data stewards, and committees to define rules
Data catalogs emerging as a data lake management & discovery tool
- Waterline is a commercial tool based on Apache Lucene and ML to help tune the catalog
- Lot of overlap with MDM


However, there is a legitimate need for minimally sufficient, and just-in-time MDM and data governance. Especially when you have multiple sources of the same data elements (e.g., customers in the POS + customers in Salesforce + customers in the call center DB); or when you have sensitive data and policies for how and whom should have access to that data.

pre-interview:

Role, team & delivery:

I'ts good to ask some questions multiple times to different people in the organisation - especially if they have different roles or seniorities - telling them that you want to hear answers from different perspectives

* what are the main challenges you're trying to solve technologically, organisationally?
* whats the thing you like working here the most?
* would you recommend working here?
* do you believe in what company does?

These days I think the questions about CI/CD, immediate technological/organisational challenges, some set of questions to determine to what extend organisation is doing agile in the name only, and possibly questions about diversity are the most important.

Another good set of questions can be found on Julia Evans blog:

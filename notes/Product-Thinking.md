Key differences:
* Laser focus on the problem. We have a tendency to jump to user stories. Anne’s “how may we” walls are a great example
* Evangelism & marketing. Refusing to allow software to sit on a shelf unused and claiming success because we delivered on time
* Bringing customers and stakeholders into the fold throughout, paper prototyping
* Visualizing the user journey and basing scope and features off of that
* Ensuring everyone knows the “why” at all times
* Separating roadmap from release plan. Roadmaps are strategic communication plans
* Focusing on detailed specs and scope clarity over ensuring the right product. Key lessons of product manager is that it's an easy trap to fall into to focus on the user stories over the actual product.
* Focusing on scope clarity over goals and vision clarity
* Focus on the long-term ownership. Our SOWs make this hard.

Why it’s hard for us:
* No persistent teams
* Short term contracts
* Single client stakeholder

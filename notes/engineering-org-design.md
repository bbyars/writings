Products all the way down

When not product
Support ticket with other team
Other team has to manage capacity
Requirements handed down tagged by a funding bucket

2 types of autonomy:
Product autonomy - the power of prioritization
Architectural autonomy - the power of release independence

Products:
Impenetrable boundary
PMs have two things: stakeholders and the power of prioritization
Requirements managed for maximum market effect
Leaders can bootstrap products when market too inefficient to do it (e.g. platforms)
Horse trading to manage most conflicts
Roadmaps based on customer feedback
Treat as if external customer
Products are owned. Aim for self-service but ownership is really the key

Capability = what
Product = how, self-service access to capability

Product mgmt:
Understanding what’s available in the ecosystem is a product mgmt capability, not an architectural capability
Understanding how to scale, tension between solving one customer’s need vs how to scale

Org has to align to physical assets of software delivery
Trying to ignore that fact is like trying to ignore the laws of physics

Channels as service delivery mechanisms

Ownership matters
Internal open source
AirBnb and Google support changing any code anywhere, but treated as open source with owners of the code having to approve the PR

Why organizing around “outcomes” fails
Collisions, build failures, defects, release management, quality and architecture curation

Outcomes focus

Organize around the axis of change

* team org = first cut of architecture
* switch from rebels to traffic cops
* putting yourself in CTO's shoes

* portfolio thinking & platforms
* group productivity
* pain now vs pain later
* op model alignment
* think of the long term

* people empathy, skills, industry
* tool alignment

Sonic - start with strategy & mission, elevate conversation; 
TELUS - show that we have their best interest at heart (eg. by team reorg), 
speak to op model, SWA - harder, ground-up success built over years)


* make it economic (SWA build, VPN)
    * Act as if it was your money to spend (rails to bootstrap nursing home app)
* DX & cost of motivation
* show what the industry is doing (Google SRE)
    * But watch out for web envy, big data envy
* harder = skunkworks (Shaw)
* pick your battles
    * not worth winning a tech argument and losing the people
    * let go of lower level details
* projecting confidence matters
* don’t forget people factors - skill, empathy 
* engage people in the creative process rather than just dropping solution on them
* designs have consequences (e.g. building on a monorepo) - be aware of consequences on team design, etc
* focus on team or group productivity over individual
    * vim vs. IDEs = great example. 
    * paul graham - lisp vs. blub; focused only on his productivity
    * boring tech should get the edge, all else being equal
* balance productivity of the now vs productivity of the later
    * A lot of “magic” can create the perception of enormous productivity now but makes future maintenance much harder
    * This is where metaprogramming can become a challenge
    * There are times when productivity of the later really doesn’t matter so much, like in a startup\
* Focus on principles and constraints
* Open forum and records of decisions so the process itself is transparent
    * helps remove emotions (“cage fights”)
* Getting ppl aligned before meeting (Talleyrand approach)
* Who should actually have the argument (enlist others)
* Useless bake-off
    * IOOS bake off showed Clojure more capable. 3 or 4 years later mostly back to Java because hard to hire
* Default “tax” on cutting edge tech, all else being equal, cutting edge loses
* Replay current state
* Sometimes attack sidewise

Endurance - how do you go the distance with your vision
Horror stories of when things go wrong
- Shaw

Approach sideways (TFS @ Shaw)


What is winning:

Preparing:
- Make sure everyone has had a chance to input! You can’t just “dictate” a decision
- Understand first, disagree second
- Body language

- approach sidewise
Feelings:
- Separate arg from identity
- Conflict is good, recognize need to channel it in positive fashion
Support:
- From the industry
- Make it someone else’s idea
Leaders role
- Cage fights
To win?

Decision time:
- Introduce reversibility where possible
Decisions:
- Reverted from mongo

Eisenhower matrix:
* Do First - High urgency / High importance
* Schedule - Low urgency / High importance
* Delegate - High urgency / Low importance
* Don't do - Low urgency / Low importance

Additional tips:
* Putting things to-do on a list frees your mind. But always question what is worth doing first.
* Try limiting yourself to no more than eight tasks per quadrant. Before adding another one, complete the most important one first. Remember: It is not about collecting but finishing tasks.
* You should always maintain only one list for both business and private tasks. That way you will never be able to complain about not having done anything for your family or yourself at the end of the day.
* Do not let you or others distract you. Do not let others define your priority. Plan in the morning, then work on your stuff. And in the end, enjoy the feeling of completion.
* Finally, try not to procrastinate that much. Not even by over-managing your to-dos.

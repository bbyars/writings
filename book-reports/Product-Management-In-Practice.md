Day to day role less actual building, more supporting, facilitating, communicating

## Themes

* You have lots of responsibility but little authority. You must lead through influence
* If it needs to get done, it's part of your job
* You are in the middle

## Key Skills

CORE:
* Communication - clarity over comfort
* Organization - change the rules, don't break the rules
* Research - live in your user's reality
* Execution - no work beneath, no work above

Curiosity - focusing on best practices leads to an incurious mindset

The potential downside of undercommunicating is cavernous and terrifying. The potential downside
of overcommunicating is a few eye rolls and some snarky comments

Intel pioneered approach called "disagree and commit", admired by Bezos
- Consensus is not the goal
- Silence indicates *disagreement*
- Commitment means everybody is explicitly taking responsibility for decisions. No one gets to slink out of the meeting with no sense of accountability

Tips:
- Introduce concept backed by Intel and Amazon
- Be clear about silence meaning disagreement
- Ask for affirmative commitment with shared accountability
- Set clear goals, test, and learn
  - If someone won't commit, it means they're engaged
  - Move conversation forward by establishing succes criteria and plan to revisit decision
  
  
Self-deprecation is an easy coping mechanism. If you cast yourself as an unwitting pawn in someone else's quest
to instill meaningless process, you are guaranteeing the process will be meaningless

When dealing with senior stakeholders, the best way to win is to help someone else win

As soon as you tell your team "our boss is an idiot", you have ruined your team

You have to push up for clarity and take ownership of the decisions that were reached

## Data

The word data is dangerous -- it wields authority without specificity

Suggest avoiding the word entirely

Describe the conclusions and how you reach them:
Instead of "our data shows that millenials are highly receptive to our value prop," try
"The email survey we conducted shows that millenials are highly receptive..."

One of best ways to open a conversation about assumptions is to build a formal template for every data-driven
decision:

### Template

The decision I'm trying to make or problem I'm trying to solve:

The data I'm using to make this decision:

Why I believe this data will help me make this decision:

What I believe the data is telling me:

What assumptions are present in my interpretation of this data:

How might we test those assumptions:

The next steps I intend to take are:

### Limitations of data

Obfuscating Quantitative Proxies (OQPs) - single dimensional numerical answers for broader qualitative questions that obscure the complexity of the underlying issue

Net Promoter Score - widely debunked but maddeningly popular

#### Template 

What is this OQP attempting to represent?

What raw information went into generating this OQP?

How was that raw information turned into this OQP?

What questions can this OQP alone not answer?

How might we answer those questions?

Based on the above, how might we use this OQP to meet our specific goals and needs?

### Roadmaps

Think of as strategic communication documents, not actual plan

Prioritization will be as easy or difficult as your goals are clear well-understood, and actionable. For that reason,
prioritization tends to be a microcosm of org dynamics at large.
Prioritization is where org goals and vision turn into actual decisions about timing and resource allocation. As such, it provides
us with a critical pportunity to see how well our org goals and vision are actuall serving our day-to-day work

The mere presence of an Emergency Issues Template decreases volume of requests

#### Emergency Request Template

What is the issue?

Who reported the issue?

How many users is it affecting?

Is there revenue tied directly to the issue?

If so, how much?

What would happen if this issue were not addressed in the next two weeks?

What would happen if this issue were not addressed in the next six months?

Who is the contact person for further discussing/resolving the issue?

A _product_ is how you deliver value to your organization's customers

A roadmap _should_:
* Put the org's plans in a strategic context
* Focus on delivering value to customers and the org
* Embrace learning as part of a successful product development process
* Rally the org around a single set of priorities
* Get customers excited about the product's direction

It _should not_:
* Make promises the teams aren't confident in
* Require a wasteful up-front process of design and estimation
* Be conflated with a project or release plan

Avoid using specific dates

## Prioritization

_Always assume you may have to stop work at any time_

Every feature has a carrying cost and opportunity cost

Prioritization frameworks:
* Critical path
* Kano (expected needs, normal needs, exciting needs, leads to satisfiers and dissatisfiers)
* Desirability, Feasibility, Viability
* ROI Scorecard (value/effort = priority)
* MoSCoW

## Alignment

* Shuttle diplomacy
    * At each meeting, identify individual's goals, priorities
* Workshops
* Software applications

Shuttle diplomacy template:

| | Juan, CEO | Mark, Sales | Jen, Engineering |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Goals* | 15% y/y growth | $24M sales | velocity|
| *Reality* | scaling company | missed targets | tech debt | 
| *Options* | stability | ... | ... |
| *Way forward* | ... | ... | ... |

Options are what do they think needs to be on the roadmap
Way forward demonstrates agreement

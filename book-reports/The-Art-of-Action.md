3 Gaps:
- Plans -> Outcomes (Knowledge)
- Plans -> Actions (Alignment)
- Actions -> Outcomes (Effects)

![3 gaps](/images/Three-Gaps.jpg]

Common Responses
- Plans -> Outcomes ==> get more detailed information
- Plans -> Actions ==> Get more detailed instructions
- Actions -> Outcomes ==> Get more detailed controls

von Moltke (Prussian 19th century general) came up with a different solution.  Leaders make sure subordinates know intent.  Subordinates have authority to change plans to meet them.

“not commanding more than necessary or planning beyond the circumstances you can see”

He punishes sins of omissions more than sins of commission.  It’s OK if a calculated risk doesn’t pay off.  This is the opposite of most organizations, which do:

- Plans -> Outcomes ==> do not command more than necessary or plan beyond foreseeable circumstances
- Plans -> Actions ==> communicate to every unit as much of the higher intent as is necessary to achieve this purpose
- Actions -> Outcomes ==> everyone maintains freedom of decision and action within boundaries

We think of it as a scale:

Alignment————————————Autonomy

von Moltke’s insight is that the more alignment you have, the more autonomy you can grant, if:
- alignment is about intent
- autonomy is about actions

Prussian army Auftragstakik, and later NATO Mission Command, represent one of the earliest well documented attempts to create a system of empowerment in a large complex organization

Depends on:
- willingness of people to accept responsibility
- readiness of superiors to back up their decisions
- tolerance of mistakes made in good faith

Strategy != plan
- strategy is a direction, not a path
  It’s a framework for decision making

Alignment:
* What is said is not yet heard
* What is heard is not yet understood
* What is understood is not yet believed
* What is believed is not yet advocated
* What is advocated is not yet acted upon
* What is acted on is not yet completed

von Moltke -> be very careful condemning action: sins of omission are greater than sins of commission
von Moltke only admitted those to his General Staff those who had proven they could disobey an order, at least in a training exercise

In assessing the performance of an organization and individuals, do not replace judgment with measures

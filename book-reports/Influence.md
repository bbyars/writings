From Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert Chaldini

Rules:
* Reciprocation: we try to repay in kind what someone has done for us
    * Free samples
    * Obligated to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us
        * Start off with unreasonable claim and compromise => rejection-then-retreat technique
        * However, if first request is too extreme, it backfires because you’re seen as unfair
* Consistency: once we have made a decision we rationalize to maintain consistency with that decision
  * Works best if I can get you to go on record
  * Get them to make a small purchase first = commitment
  * The more effort that goes into the commitment, the more the drive for consistency
* Social proof: find out what other people are doing to influence our decision
    * bartenders salt their tip jars
    * pluralistic ignorance - always request help from a single individual, not a group
    * works best under uncertainty and when observing people like us
* Liking: we’re more likely to be influenced by people we like
    * tupperware parties
    * we’re more likely to help people who dress like us
* Authority
* Scarcity
    * people are more motivated by losing something than gaining something of equal value
    * esp. powerful if it’s newly experienced scarcity

Big bang top-down transformations are possible, but requires highest level of management support and 
a relentless focus on outcomes

## Budgeting

After near-death experience of eBay in late 1990s, codified the following lesson:
Product management takes 20% of team's capacity right off the top and gives to
engineering to use as they see fit. If in really bad shape, maybe 30% or more, but
never less than 20%

LinkedIn launched Project Inversion shortly after IPO in 2011, stopped all feature
development for 2 months.

Both eBay and Google are each on their fifth entire rewrite of their architecture from top to bottom

## Devops

Use shared tooling between dev and ops to promote common view of work

Many admired devops orgs retain functional orientation (Etsy, Google, GitHub)

## Measurements

At Blackboard Learn, the # of code commits started to decrease, objectively showing the increasing
friction of adding code, while the # of LoC continuted to increase

## Batch size

Ask a programmer to review ten lines of code and he'll find ten issues.
Ask him to review five hunderd lines, and he'll say it looks good

## Post Mortems

Easy to create counterfactuals
Explicilty disallow the phrases "would have" or "could have"
"We're trying to prepare for a future where we're as stupid as we are today"
Not acceptable to say "be more careful" or "be less stupid"

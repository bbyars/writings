3 forces driving whole new design for business:
* increasing connectedness
* decentralized production
* the rise of AI

the firm is no longer the producer of value. platforms perform 2 roles:
* provide open, participative, plug-and-play infrastructure for producers and consumers
* curate participants on the platform and govern the social and economic interactions

3 key shifts moving from pipes to platforms:
* Shift in Markets: From consumers to producers
  * The business does not create the end value; rather the business only enables
  value creation. As a result, participants on the platform take on production as well as consumption roles.
  * _This applies to internal software platforms as well_
* Shift in Competitive Advantage: From Resources to Ecosystems
  * In pipes, firms compete based on control and ownership of internal resources and intellectual property
  * Airbnb and Uber instead build ecosystem of producers and consumers that they succeed in attracting, curating, and cultivating
* Shift in Value Creation: From Processes to Interactions

Scaling:
* The ability of a business to scale is determined by its ability to aggregate the inputs to business - labor and resources -
  and coordinate them efficiently toward value creation and delivery
* The mechanics of aggregation and efficiency are undergoing a radical transformation
* Inputs to business - labor and resources - no longer need to be aggregated internally. Pervasive connectedness
  allows the aggregation even when they exist externally
  
## Platform Manifesto

The ecosystem-based view of value creation is in stark contrast to the traditional resource-based view of value creation,
where control of resources was an important source of competitive advantage.

The ecosystem is the new supply chain.
The costs of coordinating labor and resources toward value creation are declining rapidly as new coordination tools
enable a distributed ecosystem to work together to create value. We saw this first in the creation of open source software.

Scale is no longer accumulation of labor and resources. It is achieved through interactions & network effects.

Community managemnt requires structuring and managing incentives for participants, enabling the learning and development
of producers, and creating a host of other support infrastructure that the human resources department would traditionally
provide to an organization internally.

*The invisible hand is the new iron fist*
The business processes that enabled pipe scale have traditionally been managed via hierarchies based on rules and compliance.
The invisible hand - typically taking the form of algorithmic decisions - nudges producers to continue creating value.
Shifts from command and control to self-service powered by APIs and data

## Interaction first

Platforms require different mental models to succeed, one that is interaction-first.

A platform's goal is to maximize the repeatability and efficiency of the core interaction

Open participation is a key difference from fit-for-purpose.
Removing barriers to production and consumption helps scale. Requires removing barriers in access and usage.
Open participation adds noise. Hence requires access controls (esp. for producers) and consumption filters.

Platforms must focus on value creation for _both_ producers and consumers

## The Platform Stack

3 layers:
* Network-Marketplace Community
* Infrastructure
* Data

Craigslist focuses almost exclusively on community.
Software platforms focus almost entirely on Infra.
Nest thermostats focus on data.

Data is important - aggregating demand allows data collection (e.g. Mint), giving additional value by comparisons

## Platform Scale

Pipes scale by minimizing marginal costs of production and distribution. They have sometimes significant startup 
costs (e.g. buy factory)

Platforms scale drivers:
* minimal marginal costs of production and distribution
* network effects powered by positive feedback
* behavior design and community culture
* learning filters
* virality

## Interactions

All interactions involve the exchange of three things:
* Information
* Goods / service (value)
* Currency

All actions in the core interaction fall into one of the following buckets:
* Creation (production, increases supply)
* Curation (scales quality of supply)
* Customization (filters demand)
* Consumption

Monitor interaction failures

The one metric that platforms should really be judged on is the rate at which value is created on the platform.

The platform provides the infrastructure and tools on which others can build or add value. It often has little
to no value on its own.

Platform strategy involves 3 priorities, aligned to the 3 layers of the Platform Stack:
* Pull (both producers and consumers)
* Facilitate (ensure tools and services to enable interaction)
* Match 

## Platform Canvas

![Platform canvas](/images/platform-canvas.jpg)

Checklist:
* What is the core interaction that the platform enables
* What is the unit of value? What is supply on the platform?
* Who are the producers of value? What motivates them to produce?
* Who are the consumers? What motivates them to consume?
* What channels are used by producers to create value on the platform?
* How does the platform manage access control for producers on these channels?
* What channels are used by consumers?
* What filters does the platform need to serve relevant content?
* What tools and services should the platform provide to enable the interaction?
* What creation tools and services should the platform provide?
* What curation and customoization tools and services should the platform provide?
* What consumption tools and services shoudl the platform provide?
* How do these tools and services help to 1) pull 2) facilitate 3) match?
* What currency does the consumer provide to the producer?
* How does the platform capture some portion of the currency for itself?

First lay it out for the core interaction, then all edge interactions

## Emergence

"You know you have a platform when the users can shape their own experience, not just accept the maker's ideas"
- Jeff Jarvis

## Curation

3 types:
* algorithmic
* social
* editorial

## Cumulative Value

Network effects aren't quite as effective as they once were.

Platforms achieve scale today by focusing on "cumulative value" - value that scales as the producer/consumer uses the
platform more often. Traditional lock-in was often predatory; cumulative value ensures that user value accelerates
over time.

Various approaches:
* Reputation
* Influence
* Collections
* Learning Filters

The true definition of quality isn't how well the software works but rather how well 
the service helps its customers accomplish their goals and satisfy their emotional needs

**Chapter 1: From Industrialism to Post-Industrialism**

1973, Daniel Bell published _The Coming of Post-Industrial Society_, posited 4 key
transformations:

* Service would replace products as the primary driver of economic activity
* Work would rely on knowledge and creativity rather than bureaucracy or manual labor
* Corporations would shift from stability and continuity to change and innovation
* These 3 transformations would depend on pervasive computerization

Industrial society focused on optimizing production and selling of products
* Functions in terms of transactions
* Relies on push marketing model (broadcast)
* Focuses on tangible things that can be touched and owned

Services:
* Happens through intangible experiences that unfold over time across multiple touchpoints
* Creates a continuous relationship between the provider and consumer (requires continuous design)
* Customers co-create value in concert with service providers
* Changes marketing from push to pull

**Chapter 2: A New Model of Control**

IT came into being to aid the quest for control
Cybernetics is post-industrial control with feedback built in
Empathy is the basis for systems thinking

**Chapter 3: IT as a Conversational Medium**

Traditional IT minimizes risk and uncertainty through formal processes (ITIL, etc)
Industrial IT lacks a conversational medium (and therefore empathy)

Strong urge to coopt Agile's post-industrial model with an industrial mindset:
* Daily standups as rote reporting rather than quick feedback
* Burndown charts become a micromanager hammer
* Sprint demos as status update rather than a conversation and feedback

Cloud's ultimate effect is to remove IT as a bottleneck to self-steer

The fundamental principles that guide IT as a digital conversational medium include:
* Design for service, not just software
* Minimize latency, maximize feedback
* Use operations as input to design
* Seek empathy

**Chapter 4: Designing for Failure, Operating to Learn**

**Chapter 5: The Journey is the Destination**

From industrial to post-industrial businesses:
* Products -> Services
* Broadcast -> Conversation
* Hierarchies -> Networks
* Scale -> Speed
* Efficiency -> Adaptability
* Robustness -> Resilience

IT's new job is to help digital businesses design and operate responsive services,
and to empathically engage with customers by designing and operating themselves

Using operations as input to design means taking feedback seriously

**Part 2: Continuous Quality**
**Chapter 6: A New Definition of Quality**

In industrial terms, quality = "does the software meet the spec"
* Did not incorporate feedback, minimizing latency, conversation, empathy
* Reflected nature of products: software companies build software; customers take 
responsibility for operating them
  
Service based quality criteria
* Does the service help customers accomplish their jobs-to-be-done?
* Is the service resilient and adaptive? (NFRs in service centric terms)
* Does the service help the business self-steer?

QA is the ultimate cybernetic process

**Chapter 7: The Four Dimensions of Digital Service**

_Reimagine QA as feedback mechanism for service, not just software_
Use it to help the entire org empathize with its customers

4 customer-based dimensions to judge digital service quality:
* Outcomes (the extent to which software functionality enables desirable customer outcomes)
  * Whether a given feature works properly
  * Validating usability
  * Seeing the world from the customer's perspective  
* Access (the extent to which operations enables customer access to software functionality)
  * SaaS brings operations out of the basement and makes it part of the explicit value prop
    that customers pay for
  * Transparency during outages creates empathy on the part of customers  
* Coherency (The extent to which a service enables coherent customer journeys)
* Continuity (The extent to which a service continuously redesigns itself)
  * Bug fix notifications are great brand management moments
  * SaaS drives the operational friction of change nearly zero, but doesn't remove cognitive friction
  * Continuity must think about change absorption ramps for customers
    
**Chapter 8: Building Quaity In**

In order to increase speed and reduce latency of feedback, a methodology must engineer noise out
Handoffs and translations are both prime sources of noise
  Waterfall maximizes both, with validating the accuracy of translation becoming a QA activity in its own right

Agile removes noise through:
* Embedded QA
* TDD
* Executable requirements (BDD)
* CI

**Chapter 9: From Quality Assurance to Quality Advocacy**

Most disciplines think in terms of action
_QA is the only discipline that focuses primarily on feedback_

Assuring quality is impossible
QAs should be quality advocates

**Part 3: A Language for Continuous Design**
**Chapter 10: The Mirror of Empathy**

**Chapter 11: Service as a Chain of Promises**

We can define a service as:
* Experience, not thing
* Relationship, not transaction
* Co-creation, not delivery

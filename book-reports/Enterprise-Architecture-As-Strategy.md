EA boils down to
1. Business Process Integration
    Enables e2e processing and a single face to the customer, but forces a common understanding
    across diverse business units
2. Business Process Standardization
    Creates efficiencies but limits opportunities to customize services

Survey. 34% companies had digitized core processes. Relative to their competitors, they
had higher profitability, faster time to market, and get more ROI from IT investments,
better access to shared customer data, lower risk of mission critical system failures,
80% higher senior management satisfaction with technology, 25% lower IT costs.

Paradoxically, digitizing core business processes makes the individual processes less
flexible while making a company more agile.

There are many types of agility, but one indicator is a company's percentage of revenue
generated from new products

Quadrant:
* Diversification = Low integration / Low standardization
* Coordination = High integration / Low standardization
* Replication = Low integration / High standardization
* Unification = High integration / High standardization

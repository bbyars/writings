"Complexity at scale has rendered reductionist management ineffective for solving these 
issues in our networked world. Efficiency is necessary but no longer sufficient to be a 
successful organization. It worked in the twentieth centure, but it is now quickly 
overwhelmed by the speed and exaggerated impact of small players, such as terrorists,
start-ups, and viral trends. Management models based on planning and predicting instead of
reslilient adaptation to changing circumstances are no longer suited to today's challenges."

## From efficiency to adaptability

[To face adaptability of Al Qaeda in IRAQ] we restructured our force from the ground up on
principles of:
* Transparent information sharing ("shared consciousness")
* Decentralized decision-making authority ("empowered execution")

Being effective in today's world is less a question of optimizing for a known (and relatively 
stable) set of variables than responsiveness to a constantly shifting environment.
Adaptability, not efficiency, must become our central competency.

Though we know far more about everything in it, the world has in many respects become less 
predictable. Such unpredictability has happened not _in spite_ of technological progress,
but _because_ of it.

Complicated vs complexity:
* Things that are complicated have many parts but those parts are joined in simple ways
* Complexity occurs when the number of interactions between components increases dramatically

This new unpredictability is fundamentally incompatible with reductionist managerial models
based around planning and prediction.

## Focus on resilience - Dutch Delta Works

Resilience = ability of system to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic function and structure

The Dutch had been building walls against the sea for a millineum, but after 1953 storm, vowed to
build the biggest wall the world had ever seen. They commenced the Delta Works project, completed in
1997, called one of the 7 wonders of the modern world. In 1993 and 1995, snowmelt in the Swiss Alps
met heavy rainfall downstream and the Rhine swelled, surging from behind the wall which protected 
against the sea. The high levees and floodwalls decreased the risk of small floods, but actually increased
the risk of larger more devastating floods because it narrowed the channels of rivers, forcing the
water to rise higher and flow faster. Due to subsidence, the land behind the dikes sank lower, and
increasing numbers of people moved into areas that had been floodplains, losing their sense of the
natural dynamics of rivers. An estimated 4 million people are now at risk.

The new approach is "Room for the River". It creates new bypasses and lowers dikes so that farmland
can serve as floodplains for the inevitable. If you fight nature, nature will fight back

_Robustness_ is achieved by strengthening parts of the system
_Resilience_ is achieved by linking elements that allow them to reconfigure or adapt to change

## Information sharing

The problem with "Need to know" is that it depends on the assumption that _somebody_ actually
knows who does and does not need to know. Experience fighting AQ in Iraq was that wasn't the case.

Focus on general _awareness_ with specialized _expertise_
They named this goal _shared consciousness_. The entire forced needed to share a fundamental holistic
understanding of the operating environment and of their own organization.

"Share information until you're afraid it's illegal"

### The O&I

Most critical element of the transformation was the Operations & Intelligence brief
Invited every member of the task force and all partners, exposing them to leaks
Claimed wikileaks style leak would be worth it

## Breaking Barriers Between Teams

Embedding program - exchange system that took an individual from one team (Army Special Forces)
and assigned him to a different team (SEALs or a group of analysts) for 6 months.

Build relationships and empathy between teams

It was a forced initiative, but elite units naturally incentivized to send their best people

Shared consciousness created by:
* systemic understanding
* strong lateral connectivity

## Communication & Leadership Behavior

Nothing was heard until it had been said several times. Only when he heard his own words echoed
back or paraphrased back by a subordinate as essential "truths" did he know the message had stuck

Behavior during the O&I essential. Never canceled and his attendance mandatory.
Would preplan questions or comments and plant them with trusted partners to help demonstrate
to everyone what he wanted the O&I to be
Could not look bored or distracted, signaling a lack of interest
Simply removing his glasses and rubbing his temple was interpreted on several continents
Always asked a question at the conclusion, even if the answer wasn't important, to show he had
listened and it was important
For younger members, even if the brief had been terrible, he would compliment it. Improvement would
come from others closer to the member, but not from the general in front of thousands
With that large a group, petulance or sarcasm could be disastrous
Required exhausting self discipline
Forced himself to "think out loud", even though it was humbling.
Overal message was that only _we_ could solve the problem

### The Dinosaur's Tail

Congressional leaders would arrive in Iraq exhausted and fall asleep or cancel briefings
that someone had spent days prepping.

The dinosaur's tail -- as a leader grows more senior, his bulk and tail become huge, but his 
brain remains modest. When plans are changed and the huge beast turns, its tail often thoughtlessly
knocks over people and things. That the destruction is unintentional doesn't make it better.

### Empowerment

An organization should empower its people, but only _after_ it has done the heavy lifting of
creating a shared consciousness

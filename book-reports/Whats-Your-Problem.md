Reframing isn't about finding the root problem; it's about finding a better problem to solve
Problem: Customers complaining that the elevator is slow
Solutions: another elevator, better motor, better algorithm (all expensive)
Reframe: Customers find the wait annoying
Solutions: add music, mirrors by the elevator bank (cheap)

Steps:
* Frame - What problem are we trying to solve?
* Reframe - Is there a different way to see the problem?
  * Look outside the frame - what are we missing?
  * Rethink the goal - is there a better objective to pursue
  * Examine bright spots - Where is the problem not?
  * Look in the mirror - What is my role in creating this problem?
  * Take their perspective - what is their problem?
* Move forward - how do we keep the momentum?

## Frame the problem

Write the problem statement in complete sentences
* It slows things down a bit, preventing jumping straight into solutioning
* It forces you to be specific
* It creates mental distance
* It gives advisers more to work with
* It creates an anchor for discussion
* It creates a paper trail

Draw a stakeholder map next to the statement that lists people involved in the problem

Look for the following:
* Is the statement true? (Is the elevator actually slow? How do we know?)
* Are there self-imposed limitations?
* Is a solution "baked into" the problem framing?
* Is the problem clear? (Often you're looking at a goal in disguise)
* With whom is the problem located? (With whom is the problem _not_ located?)
* Are there strong emotions?
* Are there false trade-offs?

## Reframe

### Look outside the frame

* Look beyond your own expertise
  * Sr. execs at Brazilian firm worked to improve market's perception of company. Financial analysts had ideas, but an HR exec asked who talked to the analysts, pointing to a non-financial solution
  * You have to actively invite them to come up with alternative framings
* Look to prior events
  * Teenager upset at teacher. Counselors know to ask "did you eat breakfast this morning?"
* Look for hidden influences
  * Walter Mischel marshmallow test: avoid eating the marshmallow, and I'll give you another one later
  * Argued that kids ability to delay gratification predictive of adolescent success
  * Original study done with 90 preschoolers from Stanford
  * Watts tested 900 children, including from less privileged backgrounds
  * It wasn't about willpower; it was about money
  * Poor kids knew not to trust adults; better off kids had more predictability
  * **This is the danger of hypothesis-driven development**
* Look for nonobvious aspects of the situation
  * Light bulb test: use heat from the light bulb

### Rethink the goal

* Clarify the higher level goals
  * Camp David Accords: Egypt and Israel's _positions_ were incompatible on territory ownership
  * Egypt's _interests_ were about ownership; Israel's _interests_ were about security
  * Allow Egypt to own it with a DMZ for security
* Challenge the logic
* Ask if there are other ways to achieve the important goals
* Question obvious goals too
  * Stephen Hawkings didn't want to type faster; he was multi-tasking while typing
* Examine the subgoals as well

### Examine bright spots

* Have you already solved the problem at least once?
  * Law partners meet to generate ideas to grow business, but never had time for follow-through
  * One longer-term initiative had gone forward. Looking back, it included an associate who pursued the idea
  * Associates felt privileged to be there and were trying to impress the partners
* Are there positive outliers in the group?
* Who else deals with this type of problem?
  * By defining your problem in less detail, you make it easier to find bright spots elsewhere
* Can we broadcast the problem widely?

### Look in the mirror

* Explore your own contribution
* Scale the problem down to your level
* Get an outside view of yourself

### Take their perspective

* Make sure it happens
* Escape your own emotions
* Look for reasonable explanations

## Move forward

* Describe the problem to the stakeholders
* Get outsiders to help you
* Devise a hard test
* Consider "pretotyping" the solution

## Overcome resistance

* Explore surprising framings
* Look for simple framings
* Look for significant-if-true framings

Utilities are costs to be minimized, not investment that yield a return.

Traditional steering committees are often staffed with the most senior people responsible for delivery, making
it an in-bred political body, not an independent board adjuticating the performance of the people. 

The board and management have divergent interests and responsibilities. Combining the roles (e.g. having the CEO
be Chairman of the Board) subordinates the interests of the investor to the interests of management, and presents
a greater risk for investors and provides lower stok returns over the long term compared to companies that have
separated the roles.

In practice, software development is characterized by poor execution supplemented by ineffective governance.

What is governance?
* Act of setting expectations
* Investing authority
* Validating the results
    * Requires data from management. When management holds back, the board's second responsibility - choosing and
      empowering management - supercedes the responsibility to validate results.
    * Compliance is a management responsibility, not a board responsibility
    * Protocols, culture, and control systems are acts of management
    * The Board's responsibility is to test, investigate, and challenge the robustness of compliance
    
An effective Board is staffed with directors familiar with the industry the company is in, and experience running
a business themselves. Not staffing financial experts in bank boards in 2008 contributed to the financial meltdown.

Software delivery has asymmetric tail risk. Potential upside is limited; potential downside unlimited.

The "agency problem" happens when different agents have different motivations:
* Accounting rules dictate that product vendors cannot recognize revenue until a client acknowledges complete 
  implementation, motivating vendor to negotiate scope down
* Professional services tout experience, but need to staff associates for leverage
* Staff aug firms motivated to expand number of people they staff and duration. Troubled IT projects work in their favor.

Capitalization: 
* Not every cost we incur can be lumped into the value of the asset: planning, technical feasibility, support,
  maintenance. 
* Capitalization reduces volatility in our net income (by spreading out investment cost)
* The "probable" test is a proxy for an accounting maxim known as the "matching principle:" whenever you report revenue,
  you must match it to the expenses for that revenue. The harder it is to match, the harder it is to capitalize.
* Hence traditional view increases pressure for big up-front design
* Capital investments have significant downside risk. If investment defaults, we can either write it off or double
  down. Writing off incurs all charges to date as an expense. This makes large capital projects too big to fail.
  
The systemic demand for predictability is an impediment to strategic software investing. Investing is not predictable.

WHen we define a business need as the sum of technical tasks (siloed handoffs), we are subordinating demand to the
inadequacies of supply.

Board shouldn't ask "how do we get the investment back on the projected path?" That prejudges the data, and assumes the
investment is sound. Instead, "what do we need to change for this investment to be viable?"

"Technology is dominated by two kinds of people: those who understand what they do not manage, and those who manage
what they do not understand." - Ron Vyhmeister

In US, directors on corporate boards have two principle duties:
* a duty of care - must inform themselves of all material relevant information, study it, seek expert advice
* a duty of loyalty - put interests of corporation and shareholders ahead of personal interests
* (not codified) duty of curiosity
    * much harder to interrogate when the news is good
    
    
Separating utility from investment allows us to allocate capital and run operations more effectively

Activist investing means recognizing losers quickly and minimizing their impact

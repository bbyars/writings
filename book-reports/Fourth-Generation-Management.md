1st generation: Management by doing - just do it yourself (limited capacity)
2nd generation: Management by directing - tell others exactly what to do and how to do it (Taylorism)
3rd generation: Management by results

Problem with management by results.  There are three ways to get better results:
1. Improve the system
2. Distort the system
3. Distort the figures

3rd generation managers are rarely taught how to improve the system; distortion is the norm.

4th generation defined by the Joiner triangle:
* Quality (as defined by the customer)
* Scientific approach
* All one team

Quality
managers job changes from expediting, fire-fighting, to gathering appropriate data, finding out about customers, understanding processes, coaching, training

Deming Chain Reaction:
Improve quality -> decrease costs -> improve productivity -> decrease prices -> increase market -> stay in business -> provide jobs -> return on investment

Many 3rd gen managers start in the middle
The only way to optimize a system is to accept some less-than-optimum functioning of pieces to optimize the system as a whole

Without an shared aim, the elements of an organization have no guidepost by which to navigate.  They operate as separate fiefdoms each pulling in its own direction

Standard practice it to believe like problems would go away if employees would do their jobs faster / better.  Keep asking “why” until we find a “who"

By early 1950’s, Dr. Joseph Juran found in studies in a wide variety of companies that an average of only 20% of the production-level problems turned out to be worker-controllable.  By “worker-controllable,” he meant that people:
* had the means for knowing what they were supposed to do
* had the means for knowing what they were actually doing
* had the means to close the loop between what they were doing and what they should be doing

Dr. Deming says that perhaps 96% of problems can only be removed by management, leaving only 4% in the hands of employees

Levels of fixes:
Level 1: fix the output
Level 2: fix the process
Level 3: fix the system

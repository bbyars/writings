Problem of 'best practice' = gets disconnected from its intent and context and acquires
a ritual significance
Need to move from know-how to know-why

The purpose of a design process is to generate information. Difference between making food and making recipes

The invisibility of DIP (design in process) is a cruel trick played on us by GAAP.
Accountants agreed that R&D expenses should be recognized at the time the money is spent.
They maintained that the value of a partially completed design could not be assessed with
enough accuracy to treat it as a financial asset. Because we never show it on our balance sheet,
we do not think of DIP as an asset to be managed. An incomplete design is like an invisible
non-interest-bearing checking account. You have invested the time and effort but not yet getting
a return. Even worse, it loses its capital very quickly.

In design, we engage in a lot of one-time processes. Rarely do the same thing twice.

When we do engineering, we stop when we run out of time. If we find a satisfactory solution early,
we use the extra time to find a better one, because there are always things we can do to improve
performance or lower costs. It means the schedule will invariably unravel unless there is a process
that compensates for this expansion.

## Model economically

4 Economic Drivers:
* Expenses
* Product cost (unit cost of product)
* Schedule
* Product performance

Psychologist have found that the absence of factual information actually increases people's
attachment to their PoV

Total process cost = cost of delay + cost of unused capacity

We will always need excess capacity to optimize the economics of the development process

The only expensive queues are queues on the critical path

### Dealing with queues

* Increase capacity
  * Common mistake = use external resources only to handle peak workloads. Ignores ramp-up costs. Feed them 
    constant work
* Manage demand
  * Control # of projects in system
  * Control features per product
  * Drop requirements during a bottleneck (model as cost of delay)
  * Reuse design content from previous products
* Reduce variability
* Focus on control systems
  * Remove from critical path
  * Use reservation system = allow us to get into queue before finishing prior activity
  
Intermingling large batch and small batch transfers doubles queue
Try to avoid large batch transfers
If can't, put them near the end of the proces

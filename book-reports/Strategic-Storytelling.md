## Story-telling approaches

* Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF) - start with the resolution
    * ONLY do this if listeners are extremely anxious and if you are reasonably certain your audience will easily understand and readily accept your recommendation
* Situation - Complication - Resolution (SCR)
    * Often the emotional tone switches from positive to negative to positive during the three acts.
    * The most emotionally intense option, best if audience does not know if it has a problem
* The Approach - Findings - Implications Framework
    * aka “What?”, “So what?”, “Now what?”
    * More appropriate for sharing information than securing a decision
    * Use the Approach-Finding-Implications framework for informative presentations
    * Avoid presenting the random walk you followed in your research process.  Give your audience only what it needs to understand your story, decide, and take action
* The Situation - Opportunity - Resolution Framework (SOR)
    * A subtle variance of SCR when you want decision makers to act in order to capture a set of benefits
    * Emotional tone often switches from negative to positive to more positive
    * Starts by acknowledging a problem the audience is often already familiar with and quickly lets in sunshine
* The Pilot - Results - Scale Framework
    * A variant of the SCR where the pilot (or small test) is the situation, the results of the pilot are the complication, and the recommendation involves scaling up

## Crafting the Story

We’ll be developing an issue tree which can be represented in outline or graphically as a hierarchy.  Outline example:

* How can we improve profitability?
    * How can we lower total cost?
        * How can we lower workforce cost?
            * How can we improve our delivery efficiency?
        * …
    * How can we increase revenue?
* …

Below is a set of steps for creating the story:

* Define the problem and make sure it’s worth solving
    * Validate whether the problem as initially stated is framed at the appropriate level.
    * To move up, repeatedly ask what impact a problem has and the assess whether the impact is one that can be addressed by the client’s key decision maker.  Intentionally go one step too far and then back down, e.g. (problem stated as poor USPS delivery efficiency)
        * At USPS, impact of low delivery efficiency is high workforce cost (within remit of Postmaster General)
        * High workforce cost contributes to high total cost
        * High total costs result in low profitability (still within Postmaster General’s remit)
        * Catastrophic losses at USPS could lead to rising national debt and drop in US credit rating (President and Congress, not Postmaster General)
    * The McKinsey terminology for this process is “moving up the issue tree”
    * The above example showed that the real problem is USPS profitability
* Identify constraints
    * In regards to example above, an example is the Universal Service Obligation (USO) which obligates USPS to provide universal service at affordable prices
* Build out the mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) set of issues
    * Mutually exclusive means independence, but don’t get hung up on perfect independence
    * Collectively exhaustive means all possible issues are included
    * Fully complete each level of the issue tree
* Convert your issue tree into a hypothesis tree
    * Convert each question in the issue tree into a decisive answer
    * “How can we improve profitability?” -> “We can improve profitability by…”
    * Keep your hypotheses SMART and testable
* Prioritize your hypotheses for impact
    * Consider an “impact” vs. “ease of implementation” quadrant
* “Ghost out” your story on paper
    * Start with post it notes, index cards, not ppts or Keynote
    * Each page in a ghost deck includes a title at the top and a sketch of the exhibit, usually a graph or table, needed to prove the title.  Forces connection of all information.
    * Can also use “dot-dash” format, e.g.:
        * Situation: USPS is experiencing unprecedented losses
            * Profits in 2003 to 2006 have swung to steep losses in 2007 to 2010
        * Complication: The “Base Case” leads to a loss of $33B and cumulative losses of $238B by 2020
            * Without action, unfavorable revenue and cost trends will continue
        * Resolution: USPS must pursue fundamental change in five areas
            * Change must occur in: Products & Services; Pricing; Service Levels; Workforce; and Public Policy
* Test your hypotheses and iterate your story
    * Must do the above steps before collecting data so you know what data to collect
    * Bright spot analysis is designed to help you identify the best practice behaviors of the people who have successful outcomes
        * Stack rank the people / competitors by recent performance into quartiles or quintiles
        * Eliminate outliers in the both the top and bottom group who may have benefited from special circumstances
        * Interview the top 10 performers.  Don’t ask them what they do.  Ask them to walk you step-by-step through a recent transaction they completed
        * Interview the bottom 10 performers, asking the same question
        * Look at the behaviors top performers apply that bottom performers do not

The title of the presentation:

* Title your presentation with a “so-what” encapsulating your overall objective
    * Should have a powerful -ing verb, e.g. Sustaining Quality and Operational Excellence
    * Avoid simple “what” titles: “USPS Future Business Model”
* Make the presentation title SMART
    * Specific, Measurable, Action-Oriented, Relevant, Time-bound
    * “Doubling Serbia’s Economic Growth in the Next Decade”

Agendas:

* Use an agenda slide to provide your audience with a roadmap
    * One of the best ways to control tension
    * Audience more likely to hold questions until the relevant section
* Keep agenda slide titles short and sweet so they can be visually ignored
* Limit agendas to no more than five short items
    * Most McKinsey presentations have “three plus one”:
        * situational background
        * complication
        * recommended strategy to solve the complication
        * Appendix
    * Purpose is merely to guide the narrative flow, not to impart information
* Add creativity to agenda slide design
    * consider converting bullet points to process chevrons or an org chart
* Start agenda items with action verbs to signal in which mental mode you want your audience
    * Unless told otherwise, executives default mode in meetings is decision making - use “Approve…”, “Adopt…”, “Authorize…”
    * The second mode executives operate in is problem-solving, use “Explore…”, “Brainstorm…”
    * The third mode is passive listening.  Spend as little time as possible in this mode because it is not an effective use of senior leaders’ time.  Use “Review…”, “Evaluate…”
* Apply contrast to highlight the start of each agenda section
    * We’re going to reuse the agenda list to start each new section
    * e.g. Add a light blue background around the “active” agenda item
* Do not include an executive summary at the beginning of your presentation
    * You want to take them on a dramatic journey, and lose all storytelling and foreshadowing with exec summaries
    * OK if the presentation is designed for reading, not presenting or as the last slide

Situation:

* Start the situation with the current state of the fundamental issue
    * The beginning should be uncontroversial - the audience should at least have a sense of the information or already know it
* To “own the flow,” each slide should trigger a question answered by the title of the next slide
    * e.g. “USPS is experiencing unprecedented losses” is a good title on a slide with a table showing the losses.
    * It triggers questions around “why,” which should be answered on the next slide
    * The next slide should list all high-level reasons - we’ll call that the key line or the summary node.  The summary node term refers to the node on the issue tree.
* Expand on the summary node with depth-first tree traversal
    * i.e. finish diving into one issue before going to the next
* Only go as deep as is needed to introduce the problem
    * Stop at the level of detail on which you intend to build in the complication and which you intend to rectify in the resolution
    * Starting rule - McKinsey often goes two levels deep
* Repeat summary node slides when moving across after going deep
    * If you choose not to do this, it is extremely important that the slide title reorient the audience to where the speaker is in the story when moving across

Complication:

* Explore issues and/or opportunities in the complication section
* Build up to contentious or counter-intuitive insights
* Explore the influence of dynamic trends on the factors discussed in the situation
    * Thinking of the “characters” of your story, e.g. profitability is the protagonist and strategic business levers represent the protagonist’s friends and foes
    * These should all have been introduced in Act I (the situation)
    * Evolve these characters through conflict in the form of trends over a series of  slides (e.g. e-diversion of mail)
* Deliver the collective impact of the complications on the fundamental issue

Resolution:

* Explore the mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive ways to resolve the complication
    * Generally three levels of effort can be applied to solve any problem:
        * Standard, low-risk actions taken as part of ordinary business optimization
        * Radical, high-risk actions leading to fundamental innovation and change
        * Maintaining the status quo
* Place low-impact resolutions in the Appendix to show they have been considered but ruled out
* Prioritize recommendations in impact-, sequential-, or emotional order
    * Default to impact, highest to lowest, to resolve the complication tension as soon as possible
    * Use sequential if actions must be taken in a sequence
    * Use emotional if the audience needs to follow an emotional path to accept the recommendation
    * Storytelling key principle: Characters always take the minimum conservative action given the circumstances in which they find themselves
    * After diving into recommendations, consider repeating the bottom line to help bring the audience out of the weeds and back to the main story progression
* Handle objections as they arise
    * Acknowledge complex changes in your deck rather than letting the audience dismiss your recommendations because you didn’t bring up the complexity
* Create an epilogue for critical information beyond the main storyline
    * Different than the appendix in that it’s presented
    * Presentation should be completely self-contained with all questions resolved by the final slide


Slide Titles:
* Use ellipses in slide titles to support the flow of the story
* Give each slide an independent title
* Use slides only when they accelerate decision making
    * Examples where slides hurt:
        * Engaging a hostile audience - suggests you’re talking at them.  Peers must be invested from the earliest stages to be bought in, with dialog, not slides
        * Brainstorming - guiding the entire ideation with slides
        * Corporate training (use “see one, do one, teach one” cycle - slides should be avoided during the last two phases)
* Apply a consistent format to your slide header
* Craft each slide title as a “so-what”
    * Key Principle: have your audience perform as little cognitive work as possible.  Do not make them figure out what you are trying to say; instead use a so-what title to tell them what you are saying
    * In general, avoid questions as titles as they make the audience do the work
    * A better alternative is to span a title across multiple slides using ellpises

Slide Body Content
* Annotations at the bottom of a slide should only be used to transition to the next slide
* Prove bold claims
* Use animation sparingly, if at all
* Lay out body content left-to-right and top-to-bottom
* Keep text short
* The larger the audience, the simpler the slides
* The content in the body of the slide must unambiguously prove the slide title
* Match the design treatment in the slide body to the message in the title
    * Text best suited for drawing attention to key insights
    * Graphs convey time-series data, composition (including rank and share), distribution, and correlation
        * Use column charts for trend data with up to ten values
        * Title graphs with a “what” rather than a “so-what”
        * Remove all unnecessary elements from graphs
            * unnecessary axis labels, lines, values, legends
        * Use chart annotations in the body to explain critical inflections
        * Apply high contrast to the chart data that directly supports the slide data
        * Use a more subtle treatment for forecast data
            * e.g. show the future in dashed line
        * Footnote sources, critical assumptions, and details for the body of the slide
            * Increases credibility
            * Allows you to quality check your numbers
        * Design stacked column charts to show an overall trend and its components
        * Orient and order legends the same way data series are oriented
        * Use line charts or scatter charts for trends exceeding ten values
        * Stick to one set of axes per graph
            * Independent variable on x-axis and dependent variable on y-axis
        * Maintain design consistency across similar graphs in a presentation
        * Do not distort graphs
        * Pie charts are acceptable for composition snapshots of up to five categories
            * Many presentation gurus vehemently object to pie charts
        * Consider treemaps as an alternative to pie charts
        * Rely on bar charts to depict composition
        * Use waterfall charts to show the cumulative effect of changes
        * Use distribution charts to show the frequency with which phenomena occur
        * Use correlation charts to illustrate the interrelationship between two variables
    * Tables are an alternative to graphs when precision is required, the quantity of data is minimal, or data is non-numeric
        * Rely on tables when the audience needs exact values
        * Use tables when you need to combine text, data or images
        * Prioritize the order of table information from top-to-bottom and left-to-right
        * Ensure that images add constructively to your story
    * Diagrams illustrate processes, relationships, and geospatial information
    * Images function in opposite ways - either they pair nicely with emotional speeches, or they convey complex, often technical information that would otherwise take a thousand words (e.g. furniture assembly)
        * Put text on images slides rather than images on text slides
        * Obtain royalty free images licensed for commercial use
            * e.g. 123RF and iStockPhoto
            * Try for PNG rather than JPG
        * Resize the image to fill the entire slide
        * Place high contrast text on images
        * Stick to a single metaphorical system across all images in a presentation
* Design each slide so that it can be covered in three minutes or less
    * Expect to fill 25 minutes in a 30 minute meeting or 50 minutes in a 60 minute meeting
* Use real quotes that you obtained directly

Slide Format and Presentation Tips
* Maintain strict design consistency
* Maximize contrast between the text and background
* Use solid colors for slide backgrounds
* Use large, standard fonts
    * Unless you’re an expert, use exactly two standard fonts in your presentation - one for titles and one for body text
    * Use large, bold, high-contrast, sans-serif fonts for titles
    * Slide titles should be complete sentences and can span two lines
    * Body text should be in serif fonts
    * Go as large as possible while maintaining roughly a 12-point delta between the two (generally at least 36 point for titles, 24 for bodies)
* Convert bullet lists into columns
* Engage your audience in an intelligent, authentic conversation
    * Be comfortable redirecting a difficult question back to the audience.  This takes guts but works like a charm
* Project the verbal authority of a peer
    * You get to choose the level of authority you command independent of rank
    * Raise your authority by:
        * using pauses to eliminate filler words
        * feeling free to ask questions
        * slowing verbal pacing
        * increasing vocal projection
* Take every opportunity to hold the audience’s attention when presenting over the phone
* Manage your fear
    * Accept that speaking anxiety is normal.  Let go of the expectation that it ever goes away and redirect the nervous energy into your performance
    * Accept that you do not need to know everything
    * Release your expectations regarding the long-term consequences of a given presentation
    * Rehearse within reason
    * Arrive early to remove the uncertainty of tools and technology
* Project the non-verbal authority of a peer
    * Gain authority by:
        * Dressing more formally
        * Taking up more physical space through larger gestures or by reducing interpersonal distance
        * Sit near the head of the table
        * Show your hands
        * Lean a little back in your chair
        * Have a scribe take notes
        * Taking notes with pen and paper denotes the most seniority, followed by tablets, followed by laptops

Focus on capabilities, not maturity
Maturity models are not the appropriate mindset:
* They focus on "arriving" at a mature state and then declaring yourself done
* Quite often a "lock-step" or linear formula. Organizations do not look alike
* Capability models are outcome based
* Maturity models define a static level of tech, process, and organizational abilities
and do not take into account the ever changing nature of the tech & biz landscape

Productivity measurements wrong because:
* Focus on outputs rather than outcomes
* Focus on local measures rather than global ones

4 metrics that matter:
* delivery lead time
* deployment frequency
* MTTR
* change fail rate

No tradeoff between improving performance and achieving higher levels of stability & quality.
High performers do better at all of these measures.

High performers twice as likely to exceed goals on profitability, market share, and productivity,
as low performers. Also twice as likely to exceed objectives in quantity of goods and services,
operating efficiency, customer satisfaction, quality of goods or services, and achieving org
or mission goals

## Culture

Org culture exists at three levels:
* Basic assumptions
* Values
* Artifacts

Westrum classification of cultures:
* Pathological (power-oriented) - fear and threat, hoard info or distort it to protect self
* Bureaucratic (rule-oriented) - Protect departments
* Generative (performance-oriented) - Focus on the mission

## Practices Correlated with Performance

* Team-owned Testing - Having automated tests primarily created and maintained by either a QA department or outsourced
party is not correlated with IT performance
* Trunk based development - Teams that did well had fewer than 3 active branches at any time

## Architecture

Key property -- loose coupling -- allows test and deploy of components even as the org and # systems grows.
It allows orgs to increase productivity as they scale. Enables:
* Better delivery performance, increasing tempo and stability while reducing burnout
* Scaling the engineering org and increasing productivity linearly or better

High performers more likely to say yes to:
* Testing without an integrated environment
* Deploying independently of dependencies

Biggest contributor to CD performance = autonomy:
* Ability to make large scale changes to design of their system without permission from anyone outside the team
* Complete work without communicating and coordinating outside team
* Deploy on demand
* Test on demand
* Deploy during biz hours

Measure architecture by *(number of deploys per day) per (number of developers)*. Negative for low performers, flat for middle, 
 hockey stick for high performers
 
## Org

6 risk factors for burnout:
* Work overload
* Lack of control
* Insufficient rewards
* Breakdown of community
* Absence of fairness
* Value conflicts

* Values – bind people to a common cause, not a central plan
* Governance – govern through shared values and sound judgment, not detailed rules and regulations
* Transparency – make information open and transparent, don’t restrict and control it
* Teams – organize around a network of accountable teams, not centralized functions
* Accountability – Base accountability on holistic criteria and peer reviews, not on hierarchical relationships
* Goals – Set ambitious medium-term goals, not short term negotiated targets
* Rewards – Base rewards on relative performance, not fixed targets
* Planning – Make planning a continuous and inclusive process, not a top-down annual event
* Coordination – Coordinate interactions dynamically, not through annual budgets
* Resources – Make resources available just-in-time, not just-in-case
* Controls – Base controls on fast, frequent feedback, not on budget variances

Effective empowerment is the product of freedom multiplied by capability. In multiplication, if one of the variables is zero, the result will be zero. This explains why so many attempts at empowerment (“devolution” is a better word) fail. Few leaders seem capable of supporting both variables at the same time.

Ross Ashbys Law of requisite variety
The more complex the environment,  and the tighter the targets, the more flexibility the control system must have "only variety can absorb variety"
- only way out is to game the system

Leaders Dilemma - dismantling bureaucracy and budget and build empowered and adaptive organizations, yet maintain coordination and control

Agency theory - Leaders act as managers (agents) for shareholders (principals) in pursuit of maximization of shareholder value
- leads to command and control
- allows for elegant mathematical models
- but analytical and systems thinking are in opposition.  Analysis involves dissecting to parts, which destroys the systems properties of interactions

Adaptive organizations value employees over shareholders.  Employees take more risk (finding another job harder than selling stock).  Shareholders a commodity that is in arguably excess supply.  Our system rewards capital investment over value creating.

cultural governance over compliance governance - create a culture of transparency and accountability

the purpose of compensation is not to motivate the right behaviors from the wrong people

transparency is the new control mechanism - publish the cost of everything
- manage expenses not by approval processes, but by making the visible to all
- if everyone can see the costs of everything, then there is far more likelihood that people will look for imaginative ways to reduces them, and harness the power of peer pressure.  
- they will have more opportunity to asses whether each item of cost adds value for the customer or just adds cost to the business - this is a key role for the finance team
- in an organization that truly believes in its core values, hiding or manipulating information must be a firing offense
 - OTOH, no one should be fired for telling the truth


In an adaptive organization leaders aim to create as many value centers as possible and the focus managers on maximizing value as measured by some variant of profit (such as return on sales, return on invested capital, or profit)

accountability through targets fails to stretch and drive improvement - one size fits all approach
- innocation and improvement more likely if front line teams have more control over their planning
- producitvity in truly self-managed work environments are at a minimum 35% higher than in traditionally managed organizations

Effective empowerment is the product of freedom multiplied by capability.  If either is 0, the result will be 0.  You cannot empower without bringing up the capability

management by exception - trust people to act within values and policies, and punish if they abuse that trust

The budgeting process is aimed at control while the strategy position is aimed at defeating the competition

the more systems become automated, the less accountability there is
-; only people can have accountability, processes cannot
- many executives would like to rationalize the problem by assuming that the problem can be fixed at the next level of detail
“who do you work for - your boss or your customer?”
- ensure that accountability naturally flows towards the customer
- accountability is often backwards - the front line teams are usually more accountable to back-office functions like finance than the other way around

Aristotle - “The problem is not that we aim too high and miss, but that we aim too low and hit”

resist the temptation to create complex systems to handle the unique or non-routine activities, because that complexity will become expensive and will bog you down… Instead empower people to handle the unique and non-routine situations.  You want people in the loop when something unexpected happens

View the investment portfolio through the lens of value centers and operate more like venture capitalists than a central banker
- transfer responsibility for resource management from the corporate center to the front line team.  This transfer of ownership changes the spending mindset. Instead of local units spending “corporate” funds which they are entitled to spend after budget negotiations, they start to see those funds as their own money to be spent with more care and attention

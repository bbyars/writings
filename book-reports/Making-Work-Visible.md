## The Five Time Thieves

* Too much WIP
* Unknown Dependencies
* Unplanned Work
* Conflicting Priorities
* Neglected Work

### Too much WIP

Why do we take on too much WIP?
* We are team players
* We fear humiliation
* We like new and shiny
* We don't realize how big the request is until we start
* We like to please people

Little's Law -> avg cycle time = avg WIP / avg throughput

### Unknown dependencies

3 types of dependencies
* Architecture (both software and hardware)
* Expertise
* Activity - where progress cannot be made until an activity is complete

### Neglected Work

Tech debt

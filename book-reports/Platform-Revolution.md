by Parker et al

A _platform_ is a business based on enabling value-creating interactions between external producers and consumers.
Its overarching purpose is to consummate matches among users and facilitate the exchange of goods, services, or social
currency, thereby enabling value creation for all participants.

Describes traditional business models as _pipelines_ -- a linear value chain. Platforms beat pipeines:

* Platforms scale more efficiently by eliminating gatekeepers (e.g. replacing editors with market signals provided by community)
* Platforms unlock new sources of value creation and supply.
  * The nature of supply changes. Supply now unlocks spare capacity and harnesses contributions from the community which used to be only a source of demand
  * Platforms dramatically reduce transaction costs 
* Platforms use data-based tools to create community feedback loops (e.g. Wikipedia replacing traditional supply chain)
* Platforms invert the firm
    * Shift from internal activities to external
    * Marketing messages now spread by consumers themselves
    * Shift from broadcast to segmentation, from push to pull, from outbound to inbound
    * Strategy moved from controlling unique internal resources to orcehstrating external resources
    
## Network effects

_Network effects_ refers to the impact that the number of users of a platform has on the value created for each user.

In 20th century industrial era, giant monopolies were created based on _supply economies of scale_.
In the 21st century internet era, comparable monopolies are being created by _demand economies of scale_. These take advantage
of technological improvements on the demand side: efficiencies in social networks, demand aggregation, app development

Often, one side is subsidized by the other side. Familiar example is Ladies' Night at the bar, when discounted drinks are offered
to ladies. When the women show up, men appear, more than making up for the discounts.

Virality can attract people to a network, but network effects keep them there.

Yahoo started out as human edited database. Google found way to use an algorithm. Networks that permit _frictionless entry_
are able to grow organically without bound.

Scaling a network requires both sides of the market to grow proportionally.

Negative network effects caused by quality problems, a curation problem. Poor curation introduces too much noise.
* OKCupid discovered the tendency of men was to hit on the most attractive women
* The attractive females are unhappy and likely to abandon the site and B-level males are unhappy because women never respond
* Once the attractive women leave, the process repeats on the next most beautiful tier, and on it goes
* OkCupid implemented curation based on:
    * compatible interests
    * Algorithm, based on reactions by other users, for attractiveness compatibility. Searches automatically use this
    
    
Four types of network effects:
* Same side or cross-side
* Positive or negative

Far easier to scale network effects outside a firm than inside it.

Ecosystems of users are the new source of competitive advantage and market dominance

## Architecture

Every exchange includes:
* information
    * must take place through the platform itself
* goods or services
* some form of currency
    non-monetary forms include attention, influence, reputation
    
The end-to-end principle: In a general purpose network, application-specific functions ought to reside in the end hosts of a network
rather than in intermediary nodes. Secondary functions shouldn't interfere with core activities.

_Platforms cannot be entirely planned; they also emerge. Most of the activity is controlled by users, not by the owners or 
managers of the platform. It's inevitable that participants will use the platform in ways you never anticipated or planned._

The problem of abundance: quality nosedives

* Reconfigure quality control through community-driven curation
* De-link assets from value (e.g. AWS)
* Re-intermediation - new kind of middleman rather than simply eliminating layers
    * Involves replacing non-scalable and inefficient agent intermediaries with online, often automated tools
    * Scale through automation and social feedback
* Market aggregation

## Chicken or egg problem

PayPal solved by
* Reducing friction (only required email address and credit card)
* Subsidized new customers - gave them $10 for signing up, $10 for referrals
    * User commitment more important than user acquisition. Had to spend $10 using Paypal
* Drove provider demand by automating pass thru transactions on eBay using Paypal
    * Noting apparent growth in demand, many eBay sellers signed up
    * eBay fought back by launching its own payment system, Billpoint, in partnership with Wells Fargo. Demanded larger icons than Paypal
    
Pull strategies more effective than push strategies
* Marketing needs to be baked into the product
* Traditional push strategies still have a place (featured in app store, for example)

Strategies:
* Follow the rabbit (avoid chicken or egg by converting product into platform, like Amazon)
* Piggybacking (Paypal did this on eBay)
* Seeding - take the task of value creation upon yourself (as platform) by acting as first producer
    * Can be seeded through simulated vlaue units (like PayPal)
    * Dating services seed by creating fake profiles and conversations
    * Quora started with editors asking questions and then answering them
* The marquee strategy - provide incentives to attract key members (EA in the gaming world)
* Single-side strategy - create a business around one set of users; later convert into platform with second set
    * OpenTable first created booking management software for restaurants to manage seating inventory
    * Once they had enough restaurants, they opened it to consumers
* Producer evangelism - Design to attract producers, who can induce their customers to become customers of the platform
* Big Bang adoption strategy - use traditional push strategies to attract high volume of interest
    * Twitter's breakout moment came at SXSW in 2007
* Micromarket strategy
    * Facebook launched only at Harvard
    
4 key elements for viral growth:
* The sender (Instagram user sharing picture)
* The value unit (The picture)
    * Designing spreadable value units crucial - one that helps to start an interaction on an external network
    * Or it may create the opportunity to complete an incomplete interaction (unanswered question on Quora)
* The external network (Facebook for Instagram, AirBnb used Craigslist)
* The recipient (The FB user seeing the picture)

## Monetization

Value categories:
* For consumers: access to value created on the platform
* For producers: Access to a community or market
* For both: Access to tools and services that facilitate interaction
* For both: Access to curation mechanisms that enhance the quality of the interaction

Examine all 4 forms of value, then determine which sources of excess value can be exploited by the platform without 
inhibiting continued growth due to network effects.

In some cases, ability to monetize may actually increase when the number of users decline - negative network effects
* Meetup decided to charge meetup organizers, weakening network effects
* That solved a quality problem - ineffective meetups due to incompetent organizers
* Number of meetups promoted on the site fell drastically, but their quality improved

Ways to monetize:
* Transaction fee
    * Can be hard to capture all transactions directly on the platform, incentivizes users to take them off platform
    * Must create tools that benefit both parties, remove friction, mitigate risk, and facilitate interactions
* Charging for access
* Charging for enhanced access
    * Important principle: ensure consumers can easily distinguish paid premium content to build trust (like Google's 
    AdWords or premium listings on Yelp)
* Charging for elevated curation

Who to charge?
* Charge all users
    * Usually destroys network effects, only use if you want to use as curation to guarantee member quality
* Charge one side, subsidize other
* Charge most full price; subsidize stars
    * Microsoft subsidized EA when creating its Xbox gaming platform, details not public
* Charge some full price, subsidize price-sensitive users

## Governance

The goal of good governance is to create wealth, fairly distributed among all those who add value

Causes of market failures:
* Information asymmetry (e.g counterfeit goods)
* Externalities - when spillover costs or benefits accrue to anyone not in a given interaction
* Monopoly power
* Risk
    * Platform owners usually seek to avoid responsibility for risks of platform participants
    * Major banks resisted fraud insurance. Freed from fear of fraud, consumers used their cards so much more often that the
    increase in interaction volume more than made up for fraud, and they now usually waive the $50 insurance fee
    * Initially AirBnb refused to indemnify hosts against bad guest behavior and Uber refused to insure riders against
    bad drivers. Both recognized how that hurt their growth
    * Use market mechanisms such as risk pooling and insurance to reduce risks for participants
    
Principles of self-governance
* _internal transparency_
* _participation_ - crucial to give external stakeholders a voice

## Metrics

Shift away from value stream metrics towards network effects and interactions
The most important metrics are those that quantify the success of the platform in fostering sustainable repetition of desirable interactions.

Stages:
* Startup - focus active producers and consumers and successful interactions
* Critical mass - shift to customer retention and conversion of active users to paying customers
* Mature - innovation, engagement, new ways to create value, competitive concerns (envelopment)

### Stage 1: Startup

3 main metrics:
* _liquidity_ - reducing interaction failure through balancing supply and demand. Achieving liquidity is the first and most
important milestone in the lifecycle.
    * Track % of listings that lead to interactions within a given time period
    * On negative side, look for occurrences of illiquidity, for example, when an Uber user opens the app and discovers no
      car is available. Illiquid situations discourage usage and must be minimized.
* _matching quality_ - accuracy of the search algorithm and intuitiveness of the navigation tools
    * sales conversion rates (% of searches that lead to interactions)
    * aim to correlate interaction percentage for particular users with long-term rate of activity of those users (say, 3 months).
      e.g. you may find that a majority of users with an interaction rate of 40% during their first week remain active for 3 months
* trust

Other options:
* engagement per interaction
* time between interactions
* % of active users
* number of interactions or variants (e.g. Airbnb tracks number of nights booked)
* interaction capture, esp. when you make money on transactions
* co-creation (% listings consumed by users) or consumer relevance (meets minimum level of positive response from consumers)
* market access 
* producer participation (dating sites measure number of women registered)

### Stage 2: Growth

* producer-to-consumer ratio (adjust to include only active users)
    * OkCupid tracks ratio of straight women to straight men and works hard to adjust when suboptimal
* producer
    * frequency of producer participation
    * listings created
    * outcomes achieved
    * interaction failure
    * producer fraud
* consumer
    * frequency of consumption
    * searches
    * rate of conversion to sale
* combine multiple forms of data into lifetime value (LTV) models
* interaction conversion rate
* side switching rate (Airbnb find guests switching to hosts)

## Strategy

Platorms seek exclusive access to essential assets. They discourage multihoming.
This is why Apple abandoned Flash.

Seek to own the resources whose value is greatest

Winner-take-all forces
* supply economies of scale
* strong network effects
* high multihoming or switching costs
* lack of niche specialization

## Policy

Externalities - Airbnb is nice for hosts and guests, but what about hosts' neighbors?

Nick Grossman calls for Regulation 2.0, based on open innovation tempered by data-driven transparency and accountability.
Juxtapose with Regulation 1.0, based on prescriptive rules, certification processes, and gatekeeping.

Traditionally, it was hard for a consumer to gather accurate information about the quality of safety of a taxi driver.
In a world of abundant information, regulation based on transparency may make more sense. Firms like Uber can be granted
freedom in exchange for access to their data.

For example, mandated disclosures of food nutrition data, auto safety, and energy efficiency have helped improve
the quality of those products.

## The Future

Types of business likely to be disrupted:

* Information-intensive
* Non-scalable gatekeepers
* Highly fragmented
* Extreme information asymmetries

Examples:

* Education
* Health care
* Energy
* Finance
* Logistics / Transportation
* Labor and professional services
* Government
* IoT

3 elements that make product management in enterprise different:
* business model
* specialization
* split between customers and users

Enterprise is rarely a scale business, unlike consumer apps

Treat customer problems as the "currency" that allows you to build alignment around a specific product vision.
No better way to gain trust and respect of groups you're trying to align internally than to consistently
represent customer problems and why they are critical to they buyers. It's very easy to focus on user problems
at the expense of customer problems ("squeaky wheel" problem), but customers buy the value prop.

3 types of knowledge needed:
* organizational knowledge
* product knowledge
* industry knowledge (the most important)

Never use the word "they" when you can use the word "we" instead.
Similarly, never use the word "I" when you can use the word "we" instead.

(A/B) Testing changes for enterprise products. When big companies pay millions of dollars for software, the last thing
they want is major, unannounced, and unexpected changes to the product. This is even more true for business-critical
applications. Instead, try:
* Allowing "opt in" to "beta" or "labs" features
* Prototype 
* Invite users to join a test and ask for feedback through a form

Your API as a Product
The New York Times is full of anachronisms. The “Gray Lady,” as it is affectionately known, speaks both to its age and the color of the paper it’s been printed on for over a century and a half. The last word of its famous slogan -- “All the News That’s Fit to Print” -- hints at a distribution medium invented over half a millennium ago by Gutenberg. In today’s increasingly digital landscape, the association of news to paper is a business problem: in 2016, the company reported a 16% drop in print advertising revenue, which points to perhaps the biggest anachronism of all: its business model. The internet has quietly turned the world’s economy upside down, rewarding advertising at the expense of content creation, and yet The New York Times is committed to subscription revenue based on world class news content. So why does Scott Feinberg say that the organization looks more like a Google or a Facebook than The Wall Street Journal?

Feinberg is the API architect at The New York Times, and has been helping the newspaper adapt to the digital world. The results so far are impressive. As laid out in their 2020 report, publicly outlining the ways in which the organization must change, the $500 million that digital revenue brought in during 2016 far exceeds that of The Guardian, The Washington Post, and Buzzfeed combined. Despite having built a business model for over 150 years that involved sending papers on trucks for distribution, and from having no digital presence a few years ago, they now have 1.5 million digital subscribers compared with 1 million paper subscribers. There is perhaps no greater example of an ancient organization successfully adjusting to the digital age while focusing on its traditional core value proposition than The New York Times, and it’s doing so through APIs.

There is a key attribute that enables their success. At The New York Times, the APIs are treated as a product.

With all the industry buzz around microservices, it’s easy to forget that APIs are what make and save money. No one will ever pay you for your microservices architecture, but they might pay you for your APIs. In short, microservices represent an implementation strategy, requiring architectural and devops finesse. APIs represent a business strategy. The vision statement of The Times is to “enhance society by creating, collecting and distributing high-quality news, information and entertainment.” In the digital world, APIs have replaced trucks as the premier distribution channel for their information, helping to transform them from a company that sends out papers on trucks to a business driven around content.

A successful API strategy requires a product management mentality, with a ruthless focus on customer-centricity and adoption. The fact that API customers are developers adjusts the mechanics of product management but not the principles: a focus on the business case combined with self-service and user experience to drive adoption.
An API Business Case
Ever since Napster upended the economics of content creation, favoring aggregators and consumers over creators, pundits have tripped over themselves to defend the the new world order even as the new economics favor sensationalist clickbait headlines over reasoned analysis. The New York Times, by remaining a subscription-based business, is consciously swimming against the stream. The Times still sits behind a paywall, a 20th century anachronism wrapped in a 21st century neologism, a risky bet that world-class journalistic excellence curated with editorial reviews from the world of yesteryear still matters.

2008 was an inflection point in the history of APIs. Both NPR and The New York Times released public APIs in the news space (followed a few months later by The Guardian). Derek Gottfrid, a Times architect, claimed it was based on a “basic gut-level instinct that this is how the internet works” rather than a carefully evaluated business case. Despite being in a separate industry, Netflix released their public APIs that same year, and for the same reason. All of these organizations wanted to “let a thousand flowers bloom,” to open up an external ecosystem and unleash innovation.

It didn’t work.

There are the exceptions, of course, like the popular IFTTT (“if this, then that”) app that uses The Times API to let users know if their favorite author has released a new book, but it was more like a dozen flowers than a thousand. While there is a certain thrill associated with discovering new apps created externally making use of your APIs, without any business relationship, most of those apps will be little more than toys. The business case of a public API was so anemic for Netflix that they eventually shut down their public APIs.

However, instead of transforming the industry, as David Weinberger argues, releasing the APIs transformed the organizations themselves. Three weeks prior to Steve Jobs announcing the much anticipated launch of the iPad in 2010, Apple contacted NPR, asking them to participate. In those three weeks, NPR was able to create a brand new tablet experience, something that would have required months prior to their use of APIs. Rajiv Pant, CTO of The New York Times, has talked about their ability to make systemic improvements to their content management system (CMS), making it faster and able to handle greater volumes of data. Such changes would have been monumental efforts prior to APIs, as all of the apps would have talked directly to the CMS.




Business case around syndication, moving news to where the users are rather than making them come to it
The Times is typical in that its Articles API provides much metadata but no actual content other than the headline, lead paragraph, a snippet, and an abstract.

There are indeed times when directly monetizing APIs makes sense, as in the case of Twilio, which sells APIs for voice and SMS messaging. For Twilio, the API is the product. For The New York Times, though, the content is the product

As Feinberg has argued, API adoption requires being open with the data. This met some natural resistance within 


“It was a success in every dimension except the one we thought it would be.”
Daniel Jacobson of NPR, which released APIs near the same time for the same reasons

News media’s internal APIs have succeeded beyond expectation because they make the content development and distribution processes far more resilient, lower the cost of building and maintaining sites, provide more granular access to content, enable experimentation, and are the backbone of powerful strategic partnerships.

===================

The New York Times uses APIs to reach a larger audience and increase the number of engaged readers. Another KPI the company uses to measure API success is the number of stories being viewed.

“Originally the goal was to open up new revenue streams while encouraging innovation in-house,” said Marc Frons, chief technology officer of The New York Times. “Those goals still hold, but for us it hasn’t been a major source of revenue yet. Whether or not it will ever be a significant revenue stream for us is hard to say.”

Yet general news providers don’t have as specialized data. The Guardian, like the Times and USA Today, doesn’t generate significant revenues from its APIs, according to product manager Sharath Bulusu. (Products of its own hack days include Guardian Tag Explorer, which taps into the publisher’s API to visually represent the most common themes in its coverage for any given moment.) The most value the company itself has extracted from its API to date has been its acceleration of the in-house development process, enabling it to bring content to new platforms, such as Facebook or the iPad, within weeks, instead of months, said Bulusu. However, he expects that to change.

Yet, all three organizations swear by APIs for internal use:
“It’s completely revolutionized how we publish content,” says The Guardian’s Tackley. The API provides a stable abstraction layer from which content and services can be easily requested.
News organizations are under near-constant pressure to keep up with the stream of new devices and services to support. An API makes this much faster and less expensive to develop.
It’s far easier to improve user-facing services because the front-end team can work independently of the back-end folks.
The hurdle to creating and fulfilling strategic partnerships is lowered. For example, NPR was able to supply content to Ford’s in-car entertainment system as easily as it does to its member stations.
The back-end infrastructure can be updated, altered, or entirely swapped out without disrupting the services users rely on. As NPR’s Moradi puts it, “It’s as close as life ever gets to future-proof.”
It lowers the cost and risk of experimentation.

 Evan Sandhaus at The New York Times has been following the development of Schema.org’s vocabulary for news articles from before its inception, including the influence that the International Press Telecommunications Council has had on it. The Schema.org approach is, he says, “probably even a bigger deal in terms of how news organizations get their data out there than APIs.” He explains that when a user posts a link at sites such as Facebook and Twitter, the sites automatically scan the linked pages for Schema.org markup. This lets them do things like format the headline appropriately for their site, display the date in a way consistent with their users’ preferences, and embed topic tags to suggest related links. “The page itself becomes kind of like an API,” Sandhaus says, in the sense that it can be queried for information about itself. “That’s huge!”

Internal APIs
No difference…

Derek Gottfrid said they had to do a lot of internal evangelism. One group thought API stood for Associated Press International.
